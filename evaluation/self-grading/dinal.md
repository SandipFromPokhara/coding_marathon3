# Self-Grading 

**Member name:** *Dinal Maha Vidanelage*
**Self-Grade:** *80/80*
**Group Grade:** *40/40*

## Justification

**Self-Grade:**

- I completed the main features assigned to me, including the Add Job page connected to the backend, JobListings, JobPage, Delete functionality, and the Login page with a custom useLogin hook. My code is structured, readable, and logically organized. I demonstrated the ability to work independently with React forms, routing, and API integration. The features work as intended in both branches.

**Group-Grade:**

- Our group collaboratively completed the fullstack application with all core features working. We communicated well during development and managed branches effectively. Each member handled their responsibilities and contributed to the final build. Authentication, job management, and routing were implemented successfully across the app.
