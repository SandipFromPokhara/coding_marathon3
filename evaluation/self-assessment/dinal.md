# Self-Assessment  

- **Member name:** *Dinal Maha Vidanelage*  
- **Contribution area:** *I worked on the frontend features, including the Add Job page, Job Listings, Job Page, Delete functionality, Login page, and the useLogin hook. My focus was on integrating the UI with backend routes, handling forms, sending fetch requests, and managing navigation and state updates in React.*

### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [Y] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [Y] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [N] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [Y] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [Y] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?  

---

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [Y] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [Y] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [Y] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [Y] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [N] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [N] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [N] Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?  
  - [ ] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?  

---

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - Successfully created a working Add Job form connected to the backend
  - Added Delete Job functionality with state updates
  - Created Login page and a reusable useLogin hook 

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - Could improve form UI styling further for better UX
  - Need to enhance validation and user feedback messages 

- **Action Plan**  
  - Practice handling async operations and detailed error responses from backend
  - Add success and error UI feedback instead of only navigating after submit 
  - Refactor form fields into a reusable component

### 5. Additional Notes
- Working on this task improved my confidence in React CRUD applications. I worked with my teammates and aligned the frontend to backend expectations. I now have a much clearer understanding of how to structure forms and manage component state effectively.
