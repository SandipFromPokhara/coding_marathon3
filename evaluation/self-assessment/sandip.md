# Self-Assessment  

- **Member name:** *Sandip Ranjit*  
- **Contribution area:** *Backend development (CRUD API, authentication, middleware, protected routes, testing)*

---

### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [Y] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [Y] Completed all CRUD features  
  - [Y] Implemented complete authentication (User model + JWT)  
  - [Y] Added route protection for all job endpoints  
  - [Y] Wrote full Jest/Supertest test suites  
  - [Y] Handled validation and security edge cases    

- **Integration**
  - [Y] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [Y] Backend connected cleanly with frontend  
  - [Y] Auth headers and tokens worked after debugging  
  - [Y] API responses remained consistent across branches   

---

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [Y] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [Y] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?
  - [Y] Organized controllers, routes, and middleware  
  - [Y] Minimal nested logic  

- **Reusability**
  - [Y] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [Y] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [Y] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [N] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?  

---

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [Y] Optimized database queries  
  - [Y] No redundant logic  
  - [Y] Efficient token verification   

Backend is scalable for larger datasets if needed.

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - High-quality test coverage  
  - Clean backend architecture  
  - Robust authentication logic  
  - Effective integration support   

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - Could add more token failure scenario tests  
  - More documentation for new contributors  
  - Improve consistency for error-handling patterns  

- **Action Plan**  
  - Expand JWT test cases  
  - Add a standardized error-handling module  
  - Write backend integration documentation  

---

### 5. Additional Notes
  - Backend remained stable throughout project development.  
  - Authentication work improved overall project structure.  
  - Testing ensured smooth merging across branches.
