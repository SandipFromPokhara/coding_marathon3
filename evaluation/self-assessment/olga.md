### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [Y] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [Y] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [N] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [Y] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [Y] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [Y] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [Y] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [Y] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [Y] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [Y] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [Y] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?
