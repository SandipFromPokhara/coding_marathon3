# Contributions  
**Name:** *Sandip Ranjit*  
**Project:** Coding Marathon 3 – MERN Full-Stack Application

## 🚀 Overview  
During the project, I contributed primarily to the **backend development** for two major branches:  
- `feature-noauth-sandip`  
- `feature-auth-sandip`  

Both branches contained backend and frontend directories, but my responsibilities focused on backend API logic, testing, authentication, and route protection.

## 🔧 Branch: `feature-noauth-sandip`

### **Main Responsibilities**
- Implemented comprehensive Jest + Supertest test suites for **Version 1 (API V1 – No Authentication)**, including:
  - `getAllJobs`
  - `getJobById`
  - `createJob`
  - `updateJob`
  - `deleteJob`
- Updated `app.js` and `package.json` to ensure proper middleware logic and compatibility for **Render deployment** (CORS, express.json, environment handling, etc.)

### **Key Contributions**
- Wrote end-to-end tests covering success, failure, validation, and edge-case scenarios.
- Improved API stability prior to adding auth.
- Ensured the backend could be deployed without breaking when auth was later integrated.

## 🔐 Branch: `feature-auth-sandip`

### **Main Responsibilities**
- Added the provided **User model (Mongoose)**
- Implemented **requireAuth middleware** using JWT:
  - Token verification
  - Error handling
  - Attaching authenticated user to request object
- Protected all job routes:
  - Jobs can only be created, modified, or deleted by authenticated users.
- Wrote Jest + Supertest tests for **all protected endpoints**:
  - Verified that unauthorized requests are blocked
  - Tested successful authentication flows
- Provided debugging support for frontend integration:
  - Token storage for authorization
  - Login/registration flow alignment with backend
